# Minimum Viable Product Base

For my personal use. Professional follow through is important. The point of this repo is to have all the follow through done at the start of the project. This way, I can just insert my project into my base and I'm ready to go.

## Features

### Basic template

Very simple bootstrap with fixed header. Credit goes to [Bootstrap Zero](https://www.bootstrapzero.com/bootstrap-template/basic). Put any edits in css/styles.css. It already auto adjusts to different sized devices, but always test that functionality to be sure.

You can generate other pages as necessary. Just make sure they have front matter for jekyll. When you add a page, you will have to add a menu link to it at _layouts/default.html
