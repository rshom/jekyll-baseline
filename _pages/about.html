  <h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
  <p class="lead">This is a tagline for my project. It is descriptive, but remains short and punchy.</p>
  <p>I can say little more here about the project and discuss intentions. This should act as a call to action and possibly include some useful links within. Depending on what type of project it is, this could be a sales pitch or a description of how one might get involved. Here, I'll sugest you fork this project and use it yourself.</p>
  <p>Make sure the about page is about the viewer and not about developer.</p>
  {% include mailchimp.html %}
  

  <h2>How it all started</h2>
  <p>This is another paragraph explaining the story of how and more importantly why the project was started. Keep these short as not many people will read them. These lines should be full of useful links.</p>

  <!--<h2>The Team</h2>-->
  <!-- I think it looks better without the heading for team -->
  <!-- try to get some images in here. anyone clicking over here clearly wants to see us. -->
{% include team-members.html %}
