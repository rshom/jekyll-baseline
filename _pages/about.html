  <h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
  <p class="lead">This is a tagline for my project. It is descriptive, but remains short and punchy.</p>
  <p>I can say little more here about the project and discuss intentions. This should act as a call to action and possibly include some useful links within. Depending on what type of project it is, this could be a sales pitch or a description of how one might get involved. Here, I'll sugest you fork this project and use it yourself.</p>
  <p>Make sure the about page is about the viewer and not about developer.</p>

  <h2>How it all started</h2>
  <p>This is another paragraph explaining the story of how and more importantly why the project was started. Keep these short as not many people will read them. These lines should be full of useful links.</p>

  <h2>The Team</h2>
  <!-- try to get some images sin here. anyone clicking over here clearly wants to see us. -->
  <p>This is my chance to share my credentials. Disregard how limited they are. Try to push traffic to other stuff I do or encourage people to contact me for any reason. Make sure to change it to about me for solo projects. Maybe plug the blog if there is one.</p>
  <p>TODO: make a little template for displaying the team members</p>
