    This is a base project for all other projects. It uses a jekyll on top of a very simple bootstrap template. A few of the pages are already filled out so that they can use my contact information and sign up for tools I already have in place.
baseurl: "/jekyll-baseline" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "http://mydomain.com" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
